# aidd-vcs

VCS workflow plugin for the AI-Driven Development framework.

> Status: stable.

First time? Install with `/plugin install aidd-vcs@aidd-framework`, then run `aidd-vcs:01-commit`.

Typical flow: `00-repo-init` once to set up the repo; `01-commit` after each unit of work; `02-pull-request` when the branch is ready; `03-release-tag` at release time; `04-issue-create` from anywhere.

Covers all external artifact creation: repo init, commits, pull/merge requests, release tags, and issue tracking.
